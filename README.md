# Computer Vision for Visual Effects
## By Hayley Roy Gill and John Fantell

This codebase was created for the Fall 2019 [Computer Vision for Visual Effects](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~rjradke/cvfxcourse.html) course taught by Professor Richard Radke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

The following video was created for our term project. It was constructed using many of the Python and MATLAB scripts contained in this codebase:

The following resources explain, in great detail, how all of the effects in the term project were implemented:

* [Term Project PowerPoint Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_z62Wy5zWep-6Wt12Hcdv7cnDaLh-EJ-CkkVM4iUV2U/edit?usp=sharing)

This codebase contains scripts that can perform: image compositing, green screen matting, feature tracking, face morphing, and other effects.

### TO DO:

Create in-depth documentation for each script.
